## Mission Statement:
TBW
## To borrow: 
Send us a DM and we can talk about ways to get you the book(s) that you want! There is a rental fee, which is determined on your preferred method of delivery. You will be charged according to postage costs rounded up to the nearest dollar in order to waive fees for those who can not afford to spend.
## To comment:
This is the public's library, and so we would love to hear what you want to see in our catalogue, what you think about a book you have read, and about your experience with us. We implore you to leave book reviews on the book's corresponding post. To tell us and everyone else about your TPL experience, feel free to leave a comment on this post. And as always, please feel free to reach out about anything. 
## To get involved: 
This project is intended to be open source. Anyone who would like to look at our internal documents, book catalogue, and anything else regarding the project may do so using the link in the bio or by searching us up on Github. If you would like to participate in any capacity, please reach out through Instagram DM or email us at `thepublicslibrary12224@gmail.com`.
