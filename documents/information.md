## To borrow: 
- Book loans within the NYC metro area can be arranged to be delivered/picked up on a case by case basis.
- All other book loans will be subject to a round trip USPS postal fee rounded up to the nearest dollar. All profits from round-ups will go towards a fund to provide 100% free loans to those in need.
- If you cannot afford to spend in order to borrow a book, all fees will be waived no questions asked.
## To comment:
- As the public's library we'd love to know what you want to see in our catalogue, what you think about a book you have read, and about your experience with us. We urge you to leave book reviews on the book's corresponding post. To tell us and everyone else about your experience, feel free to leave a comment on this post. And as always, please reach out about anything.
